# Lights Out with CSS

https://lights-out-css.netlify.app

This is [Lights Out](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lights_Out_(game)>) as a browser game,
written with HTML and CSS (resp. Sass) only. No JavaScript is required!

Currently it has 10 levels.

There is a related codepen by Kevin Newcombe called [Pure CSS Lights out](https://codepen.io/kevinnewcombe/pen/rNeMdNg), which however only works with the first level (all lights on at startup) and its hardcoded list of 4 known solutions.

I've also made a standard JavaScript version [here](https://github.com/scriptRaccoon/lights-out-vanilla-javascript).
